## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Corporations have always required timely customer experience reviews on their products to change current pricing and policies in order to keep ahead of their rivals. You will create a positive customer experience by assessing and acting promptly on consumer feelings. Social networks such as Twitter represent general public opinion and collective intelligence and can therefore be harnessed. They have evolved as a resource for extracting sentiments for applications in various fields. Sentiment analysis can be used to obtain the overall customer experience of a large customer base on a real time, as well as identifying key aspects of negative or positive sentiments. In this project, 
we introduce a BERT machine learning model to classify sentiments of different tweets extracted. 
The results between different machine learning models are also compared. 
The different preprocessing steps are also described which are done to
ensure maximum accuracy and efficacy. The sentiment analysis results can be used by managements to
take timely actions for improving the future customer experience and avoiding customer churn.
